This is a [Sponsored Portlet][] in the Apereo uPortal project.

## Configuration

See also [documentation in the external wiki][calendarportlet in confluence]. Earlier documentation may be found there, and is still relevant. We are in the process of moving documentation here.

### Using Encrypted Property Values

You may optionally provide sensitive configuration items -- such as database passwords -- in encrypted format. Use the [Jasypt CLI Tools](http://www.jasypt.org/cli.html) to encrypt the sensitive value, then include it in a `.properties` file like this:

```
hibernate.connection.password=ENC(9ffpQXJi/EPih9o+Xshm5g==)
```

Specify the encryption key using the `UP_JASYPT_KEY` environment variable.

## Migrating to v2.3.0

If using Exchange Web Services, the `configuration.properties` file has minor in order to support EWS Impersonation. Several `*Context.xml` files are also updated in case you have overridden them in the uPortal overlays.

`configuration.properties` changes:

* `ntlm.domain` is renamed `exchangeWs.ntlm.domain`. Also the meaning has changed a bit. Refer to the comments in the file.
